# OOP Read Me

### OOP

OOPS is abbreviated as Object Oriented Programming System in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class.

### Basic Concepts of OOPS

Following are the concepts of OOPS:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an attribute of an object, and it contains all data which is hidden. That hidden data can be restricted to the members of that class.

Levels are Public, Protected, Private, Internal, and Protected Internal.

### Class

In classes, we group some data variables and functions. These functions normally manipulate these variables. Before going ahead, it is better to understand what a class is: 

“A class includes both data members as well as functions to manipulate that data”.

These functions are called ‘member functions’. We also call them methods. So a class has data (the variables) and functions to manipulate that data. A class is a ‘user defined’ data type. This way, we expand the language by creating a new data type. When we create variables of a class, a special name is used for them i.e. Objects.

### Object

An object is an instance of a class. It has its own state, behavior, and identity.

### Separation of Interface from the Implementation

To access the data members of the class, we will again use dot operator. Before going ahead, we will see what is the difference between struct and class. It is the visibility of the data members that differentiates between struct and class.

The default visibility for the data members of the class is called ‘private’. These can only be used within the class and are not visible outside.

“The default visibility of all the data members and member function of a class is hidden and private”
